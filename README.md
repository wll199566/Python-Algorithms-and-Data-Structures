# Python Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains my code to implement some data structuresand algorithms following the book [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures](https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/user/login?_next=/runestone/default/index). 
Hope I can be a data scientist, at the same time, a qualified programmer.
